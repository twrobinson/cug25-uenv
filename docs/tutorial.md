# Tutorial: uenv and CPE Containers on Alps

This tutorial offers a hands-on experience with building and managing software on an HPE Cray system that does not have the CPE installed.

Specifically, you will be using uenv and a containerized CPE.

You will be given access to NVIDIA Grace Hopper nodes on Alps -- an HPE Cray Supercomputing EX system at CSCS.

## Schedule

| | |
|---|---|
| 8:30  | Introduction to uenv and Alps |
| 9:15  | Logging into Alps|

| 11:50 | Wrap up |
| 12:00 | Lunch


## Preparation

The aim of the tutorial is for attendees to get "hands on" time with uenv and Grace Hopper.
The best way to do this is by working with an application that you are familiar with.

!!! warning "BYO test"
    attendees are encouraged to bring their own application(s), benchmark(s) or workflow(s) that they would like to test.

## Accessing CSCS

### Logging In

We will use the Daint cluster on Alps (`daint.alps.cscs.ch`) for this tutorial. Login to Daint is via SSH through the front-end server Ela (`ela.cscs.ch`). 

```bash
# login to the frontend ela
ssh -A ela.cscs.ch -l <cscsusername>
<enter password>

# login to daint.alps
ssh daint.alps
<enter password>
```

!!! note ""
    :exclamation: Replace `<cscsusername>` with the username provided to you by CSCS staff.

### System Architecture

All nodes have 4 NVIDIA Grace Hopper Superchips, connected by NVLink. Login and compute nodes are equivalent, so cross-compilation is unnecessary. 

The Grace Hopper Superchip (GH200) has: 

- 72 Neoverse V2 Armv9 cores (aarch64) with 128 GB LPDDR memory
- H100 GPU with 96 GB HBM3 memory
- 900 GB/s NVLink-C2C interface for CPU+GPU coherent memory  

Each node has approximately 800 GB of total memory, accessible from all sockets. 

### Running Jobs

Daint uses Slurm as the workload manager. Slurm is configured to allocate in full nodes: there is no sharing of nodes. 

We have created an advanced reservation for this tutorial named "cug". You should submit jobs to Slurm using `--reservation=cug`. 

Make sure that you can run a simple job through Slurm: 

```bash
srun -n 1 --reservation=cug hostname
```

There are a total of 60 nodes available in the reservation. Please do not occupy multiple nodes for a significant period of time.  

### Filesystems

You have 50 GB available in your `$HOME` directory (`/users/<cscsusername>`).
We recommend building your software and running your applications from your `$SCRATCH` directory (`/capstor/scratch/<cscsusername>`), which is a Lustre filesystem.

## Using uenv

Please refer to the CSCS [uenv documentation](https://eth-cscs.github.io/cscs-docs/software/uenv/) for a reference on all of the uenv commands.

To get started, we suggest using the [`prgenv-gnu`](https://eth-cscs.github.io/cscs-docs/software/prgenv/prgenv-gnu/#prgenv-gnu) uenv, which provides cray-mpich, cmake, Python, gcc, cuda, hdf5, netcdf-[c,fortran,c++] and other useful tools:

```bash
$ uenv image pull prgenv-gnu/24.11:v2
$ uenv start prgenv-gnu/24.11 --view=default
# the default view configures PATH and friends:
$ mpicc --version
$ cmake --version
$ echo $CUDA_HOME
```

uenv that provide programming environments, applications and torch are available:

* [programming environments](https://eth-cscs.github.io/cscs-docs/software/prgenv);
* [applications](https://eth-cscs.github.io/cscs-docs/software/sciapps/);
* [ML software](https://eth-cscs.github.io/cscs-docs/software/ml/);

## Using CPE

Please refer to the CSCS [CPE documentation](https://eth-cscs.github.io/cscs-docs/software/prgenv/cpe).

!!! warning
    As a temporary workaround for a Lustre bug, the following environment variable must be set:
    ```terminal
    $ export EDF_PATH=/capstor/scratch/cscs/anfink/shared/cpe/edf:$EDF_PATH
    ```

To start testing `PrgEnv-gnu`, allocate an interactive session:
```console
$ srun -n 1 --reservation=cug --environment=cpe-cray-24.07 --pty bash
$ module list
$ module avail
```
